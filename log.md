##### starting out the challenege today, almost completed the prerequisites part of the foundation course of The Odin Project(will refer to it as TOP from now), just have the intro to git part left.

**Today's Progress**: Officially started 100 days of code today, learnt a lot about the internet's structure, all of which I wrote in the files under TOP folder

**Thoughts**: A very producitve day in general, but have to speed up a bit from tomorrow, also learning a lot of interesting things!

**Today's Progress**: Started off by finsihing the fundamentals of git section of TOP, learnt about the basic commands and the idea and motivation behind them, then solved two of the problem statements of W2 of CS50X namely: readability and substitution

**Thoughts**: Good day overall, will strive for better tomorrow!

### Day 2: October 2, 2024
##### finsihed week 3 lecture of CS50X course, and finished one problem set of the same

**Today's Progress**: Started by finsihing making notes(locally) of week 3 lecture of CS50X by David Malan. Learnt about the searching and sorting algorithms, and finished one problem set for the week, 2 more remain

**Thoughts**: Could have done more today, productivity was a bit low today, will have to diversify the day from tomorrow as was planned(by including more disciplines of CS into my daily learning).

**Link to work:** [CS50X](https://github.com/code50/79455254/blob/main/sort/answers.txt) finished one problem set of week 3, 
made notes for the lecture locally on my machine

### Day 3: October 3, 2024
##### started html, css part of TOP, and worked a bit on w3 problem set 2 of CS50X

**Today's Progress**: just started the html, css part within TOP, couldnt do much today due to time constraints and other tasks popping up, also worked a bit on the w3 problem set 2 of CS50X, couldnt get much progress out of it but will not stop the momentum!

**Thought**: The same as yesterday, but have to figure out some more time for these tasks, will try my best

**Link to work:** Was working on the problem set locally on my machine, so no link to it

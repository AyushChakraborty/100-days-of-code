### Day 0: September 30, 2024 
##### starting out the challenege today, almost completed the prerequisites part of the foundation course of The Odin Project(will refer to it as TOP from now), just have the intro to git part left.

**Today's Progress**: Officially started 100 days of code today, learnt a lot about the internet's structure, all of which I wrote in the files under TOP folder

**Thoughts**: A very producitve day in general, but have to speed up a bit from tomorrow, also learning a lot of interesting things!

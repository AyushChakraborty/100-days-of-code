### Day 1: October 1, 2024
##### finshed the git part of TOP, and finshed the problem sets of W2 of CS50X

**Today's Progress**: Started off by finsihing the fundamentals of git section of TOP, learnt about the basic commands and the idea and motivation behind them, then solved two of the problem statements of W2 of CS50X namely: readability and substitution

**Thoughts**: Good day overall, will strive for better tomorrow!

**Today's Progress**: Started by finsihing making notes(locally) of week 3 lecture of CS50X by David Malan. Learnt about the searching and sorting algorithms, and finished one problem set for the week, 2 more remain

**Thoughts**: Could have done more today, productivity was a bit low today, will have to diversify the day from tomorrow as was planned(by including more disciplines of CS into my daily learning).
